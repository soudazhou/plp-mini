# LegalAnalytics Mini Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Learning-First Approach
Every implementation decision MUST include educational commentary. Code MUST contain extensive comments comparing Java/Go patterns to Python/TypeScript. Document "why" choices were made, not just "what" was implemented. Create reusable learning materials for future reference. All development activities serve the primary educational goal of mastering Pirical's technology stack.

### II. Specification-Driven Development
Business requirements MUST come before technical implementation. Clear separation MUST exist between "what/why" (specification) and "how" (implementation). All features MUST have acceptance criteria before coding begins. Use iterative refinement rather than one-shot development. No code may be written without prior specification approval.

### III. Technology Stack Adherence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
MUST use Pirical's exact technology choices: Python/FastAPI, TypeScript/Angular, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, AWS services. Document architectural decisions and tradeoffs. Compare performance and development experience to Java/Go equivalents. NO shortcuts or familiar technology substitutions permitted.

### IV. Documentation Standards
All code files MUST have learning-focused header comments. Complex functions MUST include inline comments explaining differences from Java/Go. Create weekly learning journals tracking progress and insights. Maintain comparative analysis documents for major concepts. Documentation quality must be interview-ready professional standard.

### V. Quality and Best Practices
Follow idiomatic patterns for each language/framework. Implement proper error handling and logging. Include unit tests with educational comments. Use type hints in Python and strong typing in TypeScript. All code must demonstrate production-level thinking and maintainability.

### VI. Realistic Constraints
Simulate real-world law firm requirements and data sensitivity. Implement proper security patterns (OAuth2, data protection). Consider scalability and performance implications. Design for maintainability and team collaboration. Focus on depth over breadth - master core concepts thoroughly.

## Learning Success Criteria

The project MUST deliver comprehensive documentation comparing Java/Go to Python/TypeScript patterns. Working implementation MUST demonstrate all major Pirical technologies. Developer MUST be able to explain architectural decisions and technology tradeoffs. Portfolio of learning materials MUST be suitable for interview preparation. Deep understanding MUST be demonstrated of when and why to use each technology approach.

## Technology Stack Constraints

All implementation MUST use the specified technology stack without deviation. No familiar technology substitutions are permitted. All learning materials MUST be interview-ready professional quality. Implementation MUST demonstrate production-level thinking. Clean git history MUST be maintained with educational commit messages. Focus MUST remain on depth over breadth for core concept mastery.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. Any deviations from these principles MUST be documented with explicit justification in the Complexity Tracking section of implementation plans. All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify compliance with constitutional principles. Educational value MUST be justified for any complexity additions. Learning objectives take precedence over development speed or convenience.

**Amendment Process**: Constitutional changes require documentation of impact on learning objectives, approval justification, and migration plan for existing educational materials. Version control follows semantic versioning with MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new principles, PATCH for clarifications.

**Compliance Review**: Weekly reviews MUST assess adherence to learning-first principles. Monthly reviews MUST evaluate progress against success criteria. All educational materials MUST be validated for interview preparation quality.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-09-19 | **Last Amended**: 2025-09-19
