## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Law firm staff need a simple system to manage employee information, track billable time, and view basic analytics about firm productivity. The system should allow HR administrators to maintain employee records, enable lawyers to log their billable hours, and provide partners with visibility into firm-wide utilization metrics through a dashboard.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an empty employee database, **When** HR admin adds a new lawyer with name, email, department, and hire date, **Then** the lawyer appears in the employee list immediately
2. **Given** an employee exists in the system, **When** the lawyer logs billable hours with date, hours worked, and matter description, **Then** the time entry is saved and total hours are updated
3. **Given** multiple employees have logged time entries, **When** a partner views the dashboard, **Then** they see total employee count, total billable hours for current month, and average utilization rate
4. **Given** employee data exists, **When** user searches by name or department, **Then** matching employees are displayed in filtered results
5. **Given** a CSV file with employee data, **When** HR admin uploads the file, **Then** all employees are imported and success confirmation is shown

### Edge Cases
- What happens when duplicate employee emails are entered?
- How does system handle invalid time entries (negative hours, future dates)?
- What occurs when uploaded CSV files have malformed data?
- How are deleted employees handled in historical time tracking reports?
